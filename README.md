# Zen be with you

Hey, you! This is the repository for a tutorial I wrote some time ago for [React Redux Starter Kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit). Unfortunately the blog post is long gone, and seeing how this repository has fallen so far behind from the starter kit I decided not to repost it anymore.

That said, feel free to run & examine the code. There's definitely *some* zen still left ;)
